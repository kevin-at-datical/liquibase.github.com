# Liquibase 3.8.9 Released, Provides More Bug Fixes for the Community

Liquibase 3.8.9 is now available through [Liquibase.org](https://download.liquibase.org/download-community/).
We're continuing to improve everyone's experience with Liquibase by fixing some bugs and improving existing features. 

## Bug Fixes & Improvements
For both Liquibase Community and Pro users, we made the following improvements:
- PostgreSQL users that are using Liquibase to export and import their schemas into another database are now able to use SMALLINT columns when generating a *changelog*.
- Improved `generateChangeLog` command to assume a `diffTypes` that includes "data" when the `dataOutputDirectory` parameter is used. Most users looking to export data as part of `generateChangeLog` can now simply use the `dataOuputDirectory` parameter without needing to specify `diffTypes`.
- Enabled the use of the `--schemas` parameter to work on either side of the `snapshot` command.
- Enabled `generatechangelog` in PostgreSQL to correctly order `create`, `function`, and `trigger` statements.
- Improved the use of dblink objects when using `diff` command.
