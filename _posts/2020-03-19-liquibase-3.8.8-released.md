# Liquibase 3.8.8 Released, Provides Minor Bug Fixes

Liquibase 3.8.8 is now available here through [Liquibase.org](https://download.liquibase.org/download-community/). We fixed a couple of minor bugs in this release. 
​
## Bug Fixes
For both Liquibase Community and Liquibase Pro users, the following bugs were fixed in version 3.8.8:
- `rollbackOneChangeSetSQL` now works correctly with the Liquibase Maven plugin.
- Liquibase Pro no longer generates procedural code with incorrect SQL syntax when running `generateChangeLog` against a MySQL database.
​
