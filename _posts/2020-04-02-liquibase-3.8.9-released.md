# Liquibase 3.8.9 Released, Provides More Bug Fixes for the Community

Liquibase 3.8.9 is now available here through [Liquibase.org](https://download.liquibase.org/download-community/).
We're continuing our initiative to improve the Liquibase platform by fixing some bugs to improve your Liquibase experience. 

## Bug Fixes
For both Liquibase Community and Pro users, the following bugs were fixed in version 3.8.9:
- Fixed an issue with how Liquibase handles SMALLINT on PostgreSQL when generating a *changelog*.
- Fixed an issue with `dataOutputDirectory` parameter in the `diff` command. Users are now able to export all or specified `diffType` data objects.
- Enabled the use of the `--schemas` parameter to work on either side of the `snapshot` command.
- Fixed an issue which caused `generatechangelog` in PostgreSQL to incorrectly order `create`, `function`, and `trigger` statements.
- Fixed a Null Pointer Exception which occurred when the `diff` command encountered a dblink object.
