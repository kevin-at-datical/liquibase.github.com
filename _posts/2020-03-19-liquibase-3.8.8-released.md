# Liquibase 3.8.8 Released, Provides Minor Bug Fixes

Liquibase 3.8.8 is now available here through [Liquibase.org](https://download.liquibase.org/download-community/). We fixed a couple of minor bugs in this release. 
​
## Bug Fixes
For both Liquibase Community and Liquibase Pro users, the following bugs were fixed in version 3.8.8:
- `rollbackOneChangeSetSQL` now works correctly with the Liquibase Maven plugin.
- Liquibase Pro no longer generates procedural code with incorrect SQL syntax when running `generateChangeLog` against a MySQL database.
​

## Documentation
All Liquibase users should also check out our continually improving documentation at [http://www.liquibase.org/documentation/index.html](/documentation/index.html).

## What's next?
We are currently working on the next release, which will be a 4.0.0 Beta 1. It has been a while since we've done a beta program, 
and the last time "we" did a beta program it was just Nathan doing it! 

​We will definitely be looking for people to do some testing for us and help us find any bugs.

The plan is to do at least one beta, and will do more as we discover critical bugs. 

Major changes that will be in the 4.0 release include a change to the classloading/file loading logic, and a change to the logging system. 
Because there will be API-breaking changes, Liquibase extensions may need to be changed to work with the new version.
