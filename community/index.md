**Have Questions On How To Use Liquibase?**

Most questions on general Liquibase usage are best handled on Stack Overflow using the "liquibase" tag [http://stackoverflow.com/tags/liquibase](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/liquibase).

**Want to Use Liquibase with different databases?**

Liquibase works with many different databases - you can see [the list of supported databases](/databases.html).

There may also be an extension for your database - check out [the extension portal](../extensions/index.html).

Want to partner with us to add your extension to the main code base for Liquibase Community? [Learn how.](/extension-partnership.html)


**Have A Feature Idea? Did You Find A Bug In Liquibase?**

If it is a bug in the main Liquibase library, log it in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/issues). Liquibase has used Jira to track issues in
the past, and there are still many open issues there. You can still comment on issues there, but no new issues can be created. We will be migrating
the most important issues to GitHub over time. 

If it is a bug with an extension, log it in the issues section of the extension's github page.
For example [https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-hibernate/issues](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-hibernate/issues) or [https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-oracle/issues](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-oracle/issues).

All Liquibase-managed extensions can be found in the [Liquibase GitHub group](https://github.com/liquibase)
